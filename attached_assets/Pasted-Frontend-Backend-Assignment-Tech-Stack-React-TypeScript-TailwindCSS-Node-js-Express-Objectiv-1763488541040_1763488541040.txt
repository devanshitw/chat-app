Frontend + Backend Assignment Tech Stack: React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Node.js (Express) Objective Build a simplified ChatGPT-style application. The application should have a responsive frontend and a Node.js backend that serves mock data through APIs (no database required). Requirements Frontend (React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS) 1. Landing Page o A “New Chat” screen where the user can start a new chat. 2. Left Side Panel o Displays: ▪ All sessions ▪ "New Chat" option ▪ User info o Panel should be collapsible. 3. Chat Interface o After the user asks a new question: ▪ Fetch dummy data (from backend API). ▪ Display answer in Table View (Structured Tabular Data) along with some descriptions 4. Answer Feedback o Each answer should have: ▪ Like     ▪ Dislike     5. Dark/Light Theme o Toggle option on the top bar. o Entire application (background, font, colors, etc.) should switch themes. Session Management (Bonus Points) 6. Session-based Chat o When a new chat starts → generate a new session. o Session ID should be attached to the URL. o All subsequent questions should belong to the same session. 7. Session History o Left panel should list: ▪ Session IDs or Titles (if you can generate titles, show them). o On clicking a session: ▪ Load complete conversation history into the main panel. Backend (Node.js, Express) 1. Mock Data o Create dummy JSON data to serve via APIs. o Data should support both: ▪ Tabular display 2. APIs o Start new chat → Returns new session ID. o Ask question in a session → Returns dummy table + information. o Fetch sessions → Returns list of sessions with IDs/titles. o Fetch session history → Returns full chat history for a session. No database required — serve data directly from mock JSON files. General Requirements • Application must be responsive across mobile, and desktop. • Code should be clean, modular, and well-structured. • Refer to the layouts of the applications available (Chatgpt, Perplexity, etc ). Make sure to cover all the functionalities listed above. • Follow best practices for: o React + TypeScript o TailwindCSS for styling o Node.js Express APIs Deliverables • Frontend code (React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS). • Backend code (Node.js Express with mock JSON APIs). • Instructions to run both frontend and backend locally. • Deploy code on GitHub and share the link to the public repository.
